Code for manuscript titled "Feed balances for ruminant livestock at national scale: case studies in 
Ethiopia and Burkina Faso"

The code is set out in three workflows, one for downloading data (`1Data-download`), the second for estimating feed availability (`2Feed-geoprocessing`) and the third for estimating feed balances (`3Balance-estimates`).

The code is provided as is and will require minor debugging of file paths to reproduce our results.
